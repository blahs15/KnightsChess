# KnightsChess
A program that finds the number of permutations of having any number of knights on a square (chess) board where no knight is in a position to capture another knight.  It was written as an extra credit challenge for ECS 20 (Discrete Mathematics).  The program has an extremely long runtime.
Included is a justification I needed to write for why my program works and actually finds all the possible permutations.
